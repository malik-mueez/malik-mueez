[![Jason Lengstorf has a lot of ideas.](https://freeimage.host/i/XqKT6F)]

Hi. Iâ€™m Jason. I build lots of demos on this account and the [@learnwithjason](https://github.com/learnwithjason) organization. Most of them are built live on [_Learn With Jason_](https://www.learnwithjason.dev), a live-streamed pair programming show where super smart people join to teach us something new in 90 minutes.

I work at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=gh-profile-jl&utm_campaign=devex) as a Principal Developer Experience Engineer. For more information about me (and a whole lot of shenanigans), check out [jason.af](https://www.jason.af/).

### I have been booped on the nose <!-- boop-counter -->39<!-- /boop-counter --> times.

<small>You can boop my nose by running `npx boop-jasons-nose`. (I built this with [@gr2m](https://github.com/gr2m) on an [episode of _Learn With Jason_](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/github-automation-with-octokit).)</small>
